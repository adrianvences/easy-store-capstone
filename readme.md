## About

For this capstone project, we were provided with starter code that was incomplete
and contained a few bugs that we needed to address. Throughout the development process,
we leveraged Postman to run a series of tests to ensure that our controllers and DAOs
were functioning correctly. These tests were essential in validating the integrity and
behavior of our application endpoints.

### Features
- MySqlCategoryDao
- CategoriesController

---

## CategoriesController
We were tasked with adding the logic and proper annotations to the controller.

## CategoriesDAO
We were tasked with adding the logic to the dao. The methods were already implemented for us
through the CategoriesDao interface.
